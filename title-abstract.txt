Title:
Heterodyne!

Abstract:
The introduction of the ML Data Prep Zoo from the ADA lab at UCSD has led to the creation of AutoML feature type inference. 
Using an ML-based approach, standard ML models are built and trained on a labeled benchmark dataset that is able to predict 
feature types from columns with reasonable accuracy. To prepare this for industry use, we have addressed the scalability "issue" 
in this approach using PySpark.
