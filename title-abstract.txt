Title:
Heterodyne!

Abstract:
The widespread adoption of machine learning in industry has lead to the 
rise of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to enable scaling across a 
growing number of industrial tasks. However, current AutoML systems use 
simplistic and inaccurate heuristics for feature type inference, the 
first step in the AutoML pipeline, leading to significant decreases in 
final model performance. In this paper, we develop a scalable Apache
 Spark-based proof of concept for effectively scaling feature type 
 inference to terabyte-scale datasets, and present experimental 
 validation of up to ~500GB. As a secondary contribution, we also
  present a toolkit for quickly configuring single-user Spark Clusters.
