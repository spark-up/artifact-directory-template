Title:
Heterodyne!

Abstract:
The widespread adoption of machine learning in industry has lead to the rise of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to enable scaling across a growing number of industrial tasks. However, current AutoML systems use simplistic and inaccurate heuristics for feature type inference, the first step in the AutoML pipeline, leading to significant decreases in final model performance. In this paper, we develop a scalable Apache Spark-based proof of concept for effectively scaling feature type inference to terabyte-scale datasets, and present experimental validation of up to ~500GB. As a secondary contribution, we also present a toolkit for quickly configuring single-user Spark Clusters.
